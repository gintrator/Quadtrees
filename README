approx_color.py

Splits the input image into equal size blocks having the average color of the pixels contained within that black. Implemented using quadtrees.

'python approx_color.py <input_img> <depth>'

input_img: is a path to a square input file (i.e. pix/flower_square.tiff) 

depth: Quadtree depth, having a max value of n, where 2^n = height. A max depth will return the original image.

Output has the same name as input file, but with '_out' appended to the file name.


quadtree_split.py

Visualization of quadtrees approximating the contours of a black line.

'python quadtree_split.py <input_img>'

input_img: A path to an input file (i.e. pix/splotch.tiff).

Output has the same name as input file, but with '_out' appended to the file name.
